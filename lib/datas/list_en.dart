  "Subhanallahi wa bihamdihi subhanallahi'l azîm":
      "There are two phrases that are beloved to the Most Merciful, easy on the tongue, and weighty on the scales. They are: Subhanallahi wa bihamdihi, Subhanallahi'l azim. Meaning: I praise Allah with His praise, I glorify the great Allah.",
  "Estaghfirullah":
      "Saying 'Astaghfirullah' (I seek forgiveness from Allah) is an action that we should constantly engage in. Allah loves those who repent abundantly. It is mentioned in Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 222. Additionally, there are the following Hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): 'Whoever persists in seeking forgiveness, Allah will relieve them from their troubles and provide for them from unexpected sources.' (Source: Nasa'i) 'The one who seeks forgiveness seventy times a day is not considered persistent in committing the same sin.' (Source: Tirmidhi)",
  "La ilaha illallah":

Except for remembrance of Allah, any other talk will kill the heart. But remember Allah abundantly, as that will revive the heart.' (Ali al-Muttaki, no: 1896) Allah says, 'O children of Adam, remember Me in the morning and evening. I guarantee that I will be there between you and your troubles.' (Suyuti, al-Jamiu's-Saghir, no: 6055)",
  "Subhanallah":

  "Elhamdülillah":
      "Meaning: Praise be to Allah, all thanks and gratitude are due to Allah. Cleanliness is half of faith. Elhamdülillah fills the scale. SubhanAllah and Elhamdülillah fill the space between the heavens and the earth (or fill it). Prayer is a light. Charity is evidence. Patience is an increase. The Quran is a proof either in your favor or against you. All people wake up in the morning, some sell their souls, and others either free it or destroy it! (Muslim, Taharet, 1)",
  "Allahu Akbar":
      "Meaning: Allah is the greatest. Allah is superior to everything, majestic, and glorious. Shall I inform you of something by which you can catch up with those who preceded you, surpass those who come after you, and be superior to everyone except those who do as you do? Yes, O Messenger of Allah, please tell us! The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: 'After every obligatory prayer, say thirty-three times: SubhanAllah, Allahu Akbar, Elhamdülillah.'",
  "Hasbunallahu we ni'melvekil":
      "Meaning: Allah is sufficient for us. He is the most beautiful trustee. This remembrance is the safe refuge for all fearful individuals. With strong faith, if this remembrance is continuously recited and practiced, it protects a person from calamities and dangers that may befall their life and wealth. (Suyuti, Al-Jamiu's-Saghir, No: 3715)",
  "La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah":
      "Meaning: To have the power to refrain from sins and to find strength in obedience can only be achieved with the help and support of Allah. The phrase 'Lâ havle ve lâ kuvvete illâ billâh' is a remedy for ninety-nine illnesses. The lightest of these illnesses is grief and sorrow. (Hakim, I, 727)",
  "La ilaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lahu lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shay in qadeer":
      "Whoever recites the supplication 'Lâ ilâhe illallâhu vahdehu lâşerîke leh, lehu'l mülkü ve lehu'l hamdü ve hüve alâ külli şey'in kadîr.' one hundred times a day, will be rewarded as if they have freed ten slaves, and a hundred rewards will be written in their favor, and a hundred sins will be erased. Additionally, it will protect them against Satan for three days until the evening. No one who does not recite more than this can bring a better deed than theirs. And whoever says 'SubhanAllahi wa bihamdihi' a hundred times a day, their mistakes will be shed, even if they are as abundant as the foam of the sea.' (Bukhari, Daavat 54, Bed'u'l-Halk 11)"
